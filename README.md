# File-Extension-Spoofing-Tool-FEST-
This tool is designed for file extension spoofing. It allows users to create a copy of a file with a spoofed extension. This can be useful in various testing scenarios, including security testing and penetration testing exercises. The tool uses a special Unicode character to reverse the order of characters in the spoofed extension.
